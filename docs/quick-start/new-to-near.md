## What's NEAR?

NEAR Protocol is a scalable blockchain designed to provide the performance and user experience necessary to bridge the gap to mainstream adoption of decentralized applications. Unlike other next generation blockchains, this network has been built from the ground up to be the easiest in the world for both developers and their end users while still providing the scalability necessary to serve those users.

NEAR is built from the ground up to make it easier to:

- **Build**
  decentralized applications easily as a non-blockchain developer
- **Onboard**
  users with a smooth experience, even if they aren't familiar with crypto
- **Scale**
  throughput cost-effectively via sharding once your application is wildly successful

In order for decentralized applications to make a big impact on the world, they have to be easy to build, use, and maintain even when they scale to millions of users.

NEAR is built by a world-class team that has built some of the world's only sharded databases at scale.

## How do I get started?

1. Setup an [account](https://wallet.nearprotocol.com/).
2. Choose a [starter project](http://near.dev/), click `Run` at the top and play for a few minutes.
3. Check out the [network status](http://explorer.nearprotocol.com) (and any changes *you* made while playing in step 2). The block explorer provides you with insights on nodes, transactions, and blocks. You can look for your account ID used in step 2.
4. Dive head first [into the docs](http://docs.nearprotocol.com).
5. [Let us know](http://near.chat) if you need anything.
