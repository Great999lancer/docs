## Welcome

This section introduces you to the validation process and some additional resources.

**Important** to note: As a validator you do not have to know about the underlying blockchain infrastructure. Once you have set-up a validator node, it runs all processes automatically. Meaning, that you do not have to interfere with the node and you are only required to set up one node to start validating.

## The Process

1. To get started validating please go to the next section on [Staking and becoming a Validator](../validator/staking.md).

2. You are still here? If you want to learn more about NEAR, have a look at

    * [The Beginnerâ€™s Guide to the NEAR Blockchain](https://nearprotocol.com/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-the-near-blockchain/) to get a high level overview on NEAR.
    * [Nightshade](../technical/nightshade.md) to gain a more detailed understanding of our consensus mechanism.

3. If anything is unclear, you get stuck, or you just want to chat with fellow validators, please head over to our [Discord](http://near.chat/). There we have a dedicated validator channel to answer all of your questions.
