## NEAR Protocol - scalable and usable blockchain

<a href="https://discord.gg/gBtUFKR">![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/490367152054992913.svg)</a>

* ‚öñÔ∏è NEAR Protocol is a new smart-contract platform that delivers scalability and usability.
* üõ† Through sharding, it will linearly scale with the number of validation nodes on the network.
* üóù Leveraging WebAssembly (via Rust and AssemblyScript), more sane contract management, ephemeral accounts and many other advancements, NEAR
finally makes using a blockchain protocol easy for both developers and consumers.
